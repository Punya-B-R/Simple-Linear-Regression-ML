# Simple-Linear-Regression-ML
A straightforward implementation of Simple Linear Regression to build predictive models, focusing on understanding the relationship between input and output variables for accurate predictions.

TV Advertisement Sales Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
This project implements a Simple Linear Regression model to predict sales based on the amount invested in TV advertisements. The goal is to analyze the relationship between advertisement expenditure and resulting sales, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies.

Key Features:
- Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the relationship between advertisement spending and sales, including scatter plots and regression lines.
- Statistical Analysis: Leveraged Statsmodels to analyze the relationship and provide a detailed summary of regression results, including key metrics like R-squared and p-values.
- Model Building: Utilized Scikit-learn for splitting the data into training and test sets (train_test_split) and building the regression model (LinearRegression).
